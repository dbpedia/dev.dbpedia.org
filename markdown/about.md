# About DBpedia
DBpedia was established around producing a queryable knowledge graph derived from Wikipedia content that’s able to answer questions like “[What have Innsbruck and Leipzig in common? (Auer et al.,2007)](http://www.jens-lehmann.org/files/2007/wiki_extraction.pdf)” A community and consumer network quickly formed around this highly useful data, resulting in a large, well-structured, open knowledge graph that seeded the Linked Open Data Cloud -- which is the largest knowledge graph on earth.

# About the DBpedia Development Wiki
Since DBpedia's establishment in 2006, the DBpedia project, published several Terabytes of useful data. DBpedia is an open community project with contributions and extensions from thousands of developers, engineers, companies and scientists, which can proudly call themselves DBpedians for building a great, freely available knowledge graph of steadily improving quality.     

This wiki serves as the central point for the community to document and coordinate development on DBpedia. 
It is reserved for technical things. Other places with useful information (not duplicated here) are the 

* the [DBpedia forum](https://forum.dbpedia.org) for discussion and also where we copy documentation here
* DBpedia Slack, [sign up](https://dbpedia-slack.herokuapp.com/) for chatting
* the main website [dbpedia.org](http://dbpedia.org/) as an entry point for project presentation and first time users.  
* Documentation of the data itself is kept in the [Databus Artifacts and Versions](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia)



## Purpose of the DBpedia Development Wiki

DBpedia is the construct of hundreds of very skilled knowledge engineers that work in different areas. DBpedia was established in 2006 and back then we were a very small group that could communicate easily.
Now there are hundreds of extensions of the DBpedia data and infrastructure and a lot more developers.
Communication has become very fragmented and in order to alleviate this problem the wiki was created.
1. The purpose is therefore to collect all technical relevant information to use the data, tools and services of DBpedia and serve as a user and development guide.
2. The Wiki should be used to simplify community contributions to the core assets of DBpedia, such as the extraction framework, the releases, DBpedia Spotlight, Lookup by explaining the contribution processes.
